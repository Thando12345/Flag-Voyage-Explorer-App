**Subject:** Flag Voyage Explorer - Full-Stack Application Submission

Dear Hiring Team,

I'm pleased to submit my completed Flag Voyage Explorer project for your review. This full-stack application demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development technologies and practices.

**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/Thando12345/flag-voyage-explorer](https://github.com/Thando12345/flag-voyage-explorer)

**Project Highlights:**
- Full-stack implementation with Node.js/Express backend and Vue 3 frontend
- RESTful API design following best practices
- Responsive UI that works across all device sizes
- Search functionality with real-time filtering
- Comprehensive documentation and clean code structure

The application allows users to explore country flags from around the world, search for specific countries, and view detailed information about each country. I've implemented proper error handling, loading states, and a responsive design that works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

I've included detailed setup instructions in the README.md file. The application can be run locally using the provided start scripts.

I look forward to discussing this project and my approach in more detail.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
